# credit_risk-estimating_pd_using_logistic_regression
This project, implemented in R, involves developing a credit risk model to estimate the probability of default for borrowers using logistic regression (GLM). The model examines how key variables - employment status, bank balance and annual salary - predict the probability of a counterparty defaulting on their credit obligations.
